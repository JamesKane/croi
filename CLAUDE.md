# croi

A rewrite of Fuchsia's Zircon microkernel in Embedded Swift 6.4, with C23 or
assembly only where Swift cannot do the job. Targets amd64, arm64 and rv64.
Reference source: `../fuchsia/zircon/` (port semantics, not C++ structure).

## Scope

- UEFI + ACPI only for boot and hardware discovery. No devicetree, no other
  boot protocols.
- No hypervisor.
- IOMMU support is core (VT-d, AMD-Vi, SMMUv3, RISC-V IOMMU).
- Observability (tracing, debuglog, crashlog, lockup detection) is in scope.

## Build

One CMake/Ninja tree per arch, `build/<arch>/`. Toolchain is pinned by
`.swift-version` and found through swiftly.

    cmake --workflow --preset amd64     # configure + build + QEMU smoke test
    cmake --build --preset arm64        # build only
    ninja -C build/rv64 run             # boot interactively (Ctrl-A x quits)

QEMU uses the edk2 firmware in `/usr/share/edk2` (`-DCROI_EDK2_DIR=` to
override); `build/<arch>/esp/` is served to it as a FAT drive.

## Layout

- `boot/`     UEFI loader. Linked as an ELF static PIE, converted to PE32+
              by `tools/elf2efi.py` (LLVM has no RISC-V COFF backend).
- `kernel/`   Kernel image (static PIE at CROI_KERNEL_BASE).
- `lib/handoff/` Loader -> kernel handoff ABI (`croi_handoff_t`, C header).
- `lib/fmt/`  `TextOutput`: allocation-free text formatting for both images.
- `lib/pagetables/` Page-table formats + generic builder (loader and kernel).
- `lib/rt/`   Freestanding C runtime the compilers call (mem*, stack guard).

## Boot flow

Loader (`boot/Loader/Main.swift`): read `\croi\kernel.elf` from the boot
volume -> load + relocate it at its link address -> RSDP from the UEFI
config table, early UART from ACPI SPCR (COM1 fallback on amd64) -> boot
page tables (all RAM identity mapped RWX, UART as device, kernel segments
W^X at CROI_KERNEL_BASE; Sv39 on rv64, TTBR0/TTBR1 on arm64) ->
ExitBootServices -> memory map converted into the handoff ->
`croi_arch_enter_kernel` (boot/arch/<arch>/enter.S). Loader allocations
use OS-defined memory types 0x80000001 (kernel) / 0x80000002 (handoff and
page tables) so they show up as CROI_MEM_KERNEL / CROI_MEM_HANDOFF.

Kernel (`kernel/Kernel/Main.swift`): validates the handoff, builds its own
page tables from free RAM with `BootAllocator` (front-to-back, never frees;
reads the handoff range table in place, which is CROI_MEM_HANDOFF and so
never handed out), and switches to them. Kernel address space
(`KernelLayout`): low half empty; physmap of all RAM at 0xffff800000000000
(amd64/arm64) or 0xffffffc000000000 (rv64 Sv39), RW + NX; device registers
the kernel uses are mapped in the physmap as device memory; the image at
CROI_KERNEL_BASE with text RX, rodata R, data RW. amd64 loads its own GDT
first thing, since firmware's sits in memory reported free.

Exceptions: `arch/<arch>/exceptions.S` saves an `arch_exception_frame_t`
(kernel.h) and calls Swift `arch_exception` (Kernel/Exceptions.swift);
the handler may edit the frame to resume elsewhere. Installed at the top
of kernel_main. amd64: IDT of 256 stubs, TSS with IST1 for NMI/#DF/#MC.
arm64: VBAR_EL1. rv64: stvec, S-mode traps only. Breakpoints resume (the
boot test checks one round trip); anything else prints a register dump to
`panicConsole` and halts via `panic()`. No stack guard pages yet, so kernel
stack overflow is not caught. A deliberate fault in kernel code must use a
volatile access, or LLVM may delete it (e.g. stores to const symbols).

Kernel enters on the loader's page tables with the handoff's physical
address as its argument, at EL1 on arm64: if firmware ran at EL2, the
trampoline neutralizes EL2 (HCR_EL2 = RW only; timer, PMU and GICv3 sysregs
handed to EL1) and drops to EL1 after ExitBootServices. Not yet supported:
amd64 5-level paging, KASLR, CPUs where HCR_EL2.E2H is RES1 (VHE-only).
EL2 does not yet un-trap pointer authentication (HCR_EL2.API/APK), so the
kernel must not use PAC until it does.
- `ld/image.ld` Shared linker script: one PT_LOAD per permission (W^X).
- `cmake/`    Toolchain file, per-arch settings, `croi_image()` helper.

## Conventions

- When C or asm is used, say why in the file's header comment. Today: UEFI
  calling-convention shims, entry/start code, compiler runtime.
- C boundary: declare in a header, implement in Swift with
  `@c @implementation`. The Swift function must keep the C name
  (`kernel_main`); `@c(name)` and `swift_name` don't work with it in 6.4.0.
- Swift is built with `-strict-memory-safety` (errors): every unsafe use is
  marked `unsafe`; types that wrap raw pointers are `@safe` with `@unsafe`
  initializers documenting the contract.
- Prefer 6.4 / ownership-era APIs: `Span`/`MutableSpan`/`RawSpan`,
  `InlineArray`, span-based `withTemporaryAllocation`, `~Copyable` types,
  `UniqueBox`/`UniqueArray` (no CoW), typed throws, `Atomic`
  (Synchronization), `@section`/`@used`. Avoid existentials and untyped
  `throws` in kernel paths (they allocate); `PerformanceHints` warns.
  Span-returning properties need `@_lifetime(...)` (Lifetimes feature is on).
- No floating point in kernel code. On amd64 Swift can't be built with x87
  disabled, so `Double` would compile silently to x87; don't use it.
- Loader and kernel have no heap: there is no malloc, so any hidden
  allocation fails the link (find it with `ld.lld --why-live=swift_slowAlloc`).
  `withTemporaryAllocation` can fall back to the heap; use `InlineArray`
  stack buffers instead.
- C constants Swift must see are typed C23 enums (`enum : uint64_t {...}`),
  not macros with casts, which Swift does not import.
- Small Swift globals are fine (`nonisolated(unsafe) var`; zero/nil
  initializers are static at -Osize). Large tables and stacks go in
  assembly `.bss`: Swift still emits lazy initializers for them.
- Linking uses `--orphan-handling=error`: new sections must be placed in
  `ld/image.ld` explicitly.
